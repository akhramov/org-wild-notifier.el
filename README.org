** What is it?
A package which adds notification support for org-agenda views.
With this package you'll get notifications for ~TODO~ entries.

** How does it differ from existing packages?
There are few good org agenda notification packages I'm aware of:

- [[https://github.com/spegoraro/org-alert][org-alert]] notifies about deadlines every N minutes using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] package.
- [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/contrib/lisp/org-notify.el][org-notify]] complex, feature-rich library from Org contrib directory.

While aforementioned packages are good on their own, I wanted to have
something that resembles popular Calendar solutions, something that'd
be unobtrusive in use and configuration.

** Configuration?

Oh, yes. This package provides some configuration options:

| Description                                  | Variable                               | Default value               |
|----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Alert time in minutes                        | org-wild-notifier-alert-time           | 10                          |
| Title of notifications                       | org-wild-notifier-notification-title   | Agenda                      |
| Property which adds additional notifications | org-wild-notifier-alert-times-property | WILD_NOTIFIER_NOTIFY_BEFORE |

The last property demands further explanations.

Let's suppose you have an important event. One standard 10-minute notification
is not enough. Fear not, let's modify our Org entry.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* TODO Visit the chocolate factory
  SCHEDULED: <2018-01-04 Thu 16:00>
  :PROPERTIES:
  :WILD_NOTIFIER_NOTIFY_BEFORE: 80 60 55 43 5
  :END:
#+END_SRC

With such configuration you'll get notifications 80, 60, 55, 43, *10*
and 5 minutes before the event.

*** How do I customize alerts?

As ~org-alert~, this package is based on [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] package. Alert offers a
wide range of customizations through it's [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert#builtin-alert-styles][styles]] facility.
Good examples on how to define your own styles can be found in alert
source code.
A bad example on how to define your own styles can be found [[https://github.com/akhramov/emacs.d/blob/master/packages/wild-notifier.el][here]].


** How do I install the package?
This package is available on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].

** How do I use the package?

This package works in two modes:
- Timer mode: automatically runs checks once a minute. Can be enabled
  by ~org-wild-notifier-start~ and stopped by ~org-wild-notifier-start~.
- Manual mode: user runs checks by invoking ~org-wild-notifier-check~.

** Wait. Wild?

What'd you expect? I have literally no imagination.
